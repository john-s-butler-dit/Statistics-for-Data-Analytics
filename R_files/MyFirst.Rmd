```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Question 1


```{r Q1, echo=FALSE}

X<-c(0,1,2,3,4)
P<-c(0.1,0.2,0.4,0.2,0.1)

E<-sum(X*P)
print(E)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
